# Developing the Stanford Decanter (v7) theme

This theme requires [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (or similar) package manager for development. Every time a css or template file changes, the main.css file in css/ must be recompiled using tailwind. If you have yarn or npm installed you can use it to trigger the compile step:

- From within the theme directory run:

  ```sh
  yarn install && yarn build;
  ```

- You can recompile automatically while developing by running:

  ```sh
  yarn watch
  ```

## Compiled output

The following files are compiled automatically and should not be directly edited:

- `dist/main.compiled.css` (Edit [`src/main.css`](../src/main.css) instead)

## Colors

This theme supports custom colors using the Color module. To keep this support please make sure to update [`css/skin.css`](../css/skin.css), [`theme-settings.php`](../theme-settings.php) and [`color/color.inc`](../color/color.inc) files.

## Pushing code changes

Github actions will build and commit the output upon push.
